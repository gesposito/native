# [It's time to go Native (with JavaScript and React Native)](http://www.esposi.to/native/)

This repository contains code originally developed for my [Codemotion Milan 2015 Conference](http://milan2015.codemotionworld.com/conference/) slides

I also developed a Conference App (mostly a proof of concept):
[Codemotion Milan 2015 App](https://github.com/gesposito/CodemotionMilan2015)

## How to install
You need [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) either for iOS, Android or both.

Then, inside this project:

`npm install`

## How to run

**To run your app on iOS:**

- `react-native run-ios`

**To run your app on Android:**

- `react-native run-android`
