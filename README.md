# [It's time to go Native (with JavaScript and React Native)](http://www.esposi.to/native/)

This repository contains code from my slides for [Codemotion Milan 2015 Conference](http://milan2015.codemotionworld.com/conference/)

I also developed a Conference App (mostly a proof of concept):
[Codemotion Milan 2015 App](https://github.com/gesposito/CodemotionMilan2015)

## How to install
You need [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) either for iOS, Android or both.

Then, inside this project:

`npm install`

## How to run

**To run the iOS app:**

- Open `ios/CodemotionAwesomeProject.xcodeproj` and hit run in Xcode.
- Open `index.ios.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Hit ⌘-R in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

**To run the Android app:**

- `react-native run-android`
- Open `index.android.js` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
- Press the menu button (F2 by default, or ⌘-M in Genymotion) and select *Reload JS* to see your change!
